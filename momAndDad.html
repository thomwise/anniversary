                <p class="content">
                    You have brought four incredible people on this earth who are doing amazing things with their lives.
                    <br><br>
                    Again and again the generosity experienced by the Kenny's is overwhelming for those you are in relationship with, love and compassion that comes from all members of the Kenny family.
                    <br><br>
                    When asking people if they know the Kenny's, a smile is automatically drawn across their face as they answer, "Yes! They are amazing!"

                    You are constant.
                    <br><br>
                    Hills and valleys come and go yet you remain constant. Constant in your pursuit of God’s heart for others, constant in your commitment to each other, constant in your love and support of your kids and now grandkids. When it feels like all things have fallen down around you, you remain standing.
                    <br><br>
                    You have fostered a family that knows what love is, love of God, love of self and love of others and whether you feel it or not, the love you give away is felt by so many more... this is your legacy.

                    Mom and Dad, wow...
                    <br><br>
                    There truly aren't enough words to describe my love and admiration for you both. when I think of your legacy, the simple but powerful quote by St. Francis of Assisi comes to mind. "Preach the gospel always, and when necessary use words." I don't know anyone else who does this as well as you do. You live your lives out of service,  love and generosity. You provide unconditional support and wisdom to so many. You come alongside the broken and displaced and provide a sense of home. I have such an incredible amount of pride in the fact that you are my parents. Not only have you been the most incredible parents to your four, but you have embraced parenthood and all the beauty and redemption that comes with it and have brought it to so many others.
                    <br><br>
                    I am so thankful you have stuck with each other all these years. Your commitment to each other and the people you love is powerful. You are sooooooo loved and respected. Thank you for all you do and have done. I will continue to be amazed by your legacy. Love you to the moon and back.
                    <br><br>
                    Always, Rachel and Thom

                    It is difficult to put into words just how grateful we are for both of you. Over the years you have taught us by your actions to love abundantly, give generously, take whatever comes at us with open hands and to offer grace freely. This is your legacy. Because of you, these things will be be passed on through generations to come. 
                    <br><br>
                    Romans 12 talks about sharing with the Lords people and remaining devoted to one another in love- THIS is both of you- together and as individuals. Our family loves each other deeply and we find joy being with one another. How absolutely thankful we are for what you both have sacrificed and given to create our amazing family.  We love you dearly. Happy anniversary!

                    There is no way I can describe how much you mean to me. Priceless is the knowledge, passion, love, and truth that you pass on to those you are around, and to those you have raised. You practice what you preach, and preach what you practice. 
                    The foundation on which we were raised is strong and meaningful. 
                    <br><br>
                    You have shown us all what it means to consider the lives of others and to love without judgement. Thank you for everything you have done and will continue to do for us, and those around you. Anyone who crosses paths with you is lucky to have done so. 
                    <br><br>
                    I love you both so much

                    Who would have known when I met you Nina, years ago, that our paths would cross again at On Ramps. I am so grateful for you and your music ministry. Jeff I so appreciate you and the great friend you are to my husband, he loves you. Also, your ceramic skills are on point. I love my pitcher. Your lives are a great ministry that speaks volumes. No sermon series could top what your lives Preach and teach about God’s love and grace.

                    Well, I was there from the beginning of your beautiful relationship and although I was not quite sure of this “Jeff Kenny” for you Nina (LOL!), you two fell in love and quickly relieved any fears of mine! You became a family and love grew! It has been an inspiration to watch you both grow your love for each other and your family, with Christ always being at the center of your lives! Your loving, beautifully, gifted family is a testament of the love and dedication you two give them. All of the ways that you’ve extended your family and the ways that you have included us has been a true blessing to us!
                    <br><br>
