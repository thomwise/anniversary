                    You have brought four incredible people on this earth who are doing amazing things with their lives.
                    <br><br>
                    Again and again I am astounded by the generosity, love and compassion that comes from all members of the Kenny family.
                    <br><br>
                    When asking people if they know the Kenny's, a smile is automatically drawn across their face as they answer, "Yes! They are amazing!"
