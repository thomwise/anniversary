                    You have brought four incredible people on this earth who are doing amazing things with their lives.
                    <br><br>
                    Again and again the generosity experienced by the Kenny's is overwhelming for those you are in relationship with, love and compassion that comes from all members of the Kenny family.
                    <br><br>
                    When asking people if they know the Kenny's, a smile is automatically drawn across their face as they answer, "Yes! They are amazing!"

                    You two are such a perfect example of what marriage is.  You can see the love you two have and the care you have for each other.  People feel safe around you and your home.  I feel warm and at peace when you two are around.  You two are a gift to your family,  friends,  neighbors, church family and strangers. Celebrate your love this week and everyday.

                    Who would have known when I met you Nina, years ago, that our paths would cross again at On Ramps. I am so grateful for you and your music ministry. Jeff I so appreciate you and the great friend you are to my husband, he loves you. Also, your ceramic skills are on point. I love my pitcher. Your lives are a great ministry that speaks volumes. No sermon series could top what your lives Preach and teach about God‚Äôs love and grace.

                    <br><br>
                    Well, I was there from the beginning of your beautiful relationship and although I was not quite sure of this ‚ÄúJeff Kenny‚Äù for you Nina (LOL!), you two fell in love and quickly relieved any fears of mine! You became a family and love grew! It has been an inspiration to watch you both grow your love for each other and your family, with Christ always being at the center of your lives! Your loving, beautifully, gifted family is a testament of the love and dedication you two give them. All of the ways that you‚Äôve extended your family and the ways that you have included us has been a true blessing to us!
                    <br><br>
                    We love you both so much!

                    What can i say? Lol... I love u both so very much. You have been very influential in my life. Both as parents and as a married couple to look up to. You have been there for me during some very tuff times and have always shown my son and i love like none other. I thank God he put you in our paths. I admire what wonderful, Godly, wise, examples you have been. When im not doing right and i need to get it together you have no problem correcting me in love and i appreciate that. I pray your anniversary was as wonderful as you are. I pray for many many more blessed and joyous years! I don't know what i would have done without you guys. Love you sooo very much!!
